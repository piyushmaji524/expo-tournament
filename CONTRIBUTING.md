# Contributing to Expo Tournament

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Expo Tournament as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your-username/expo-tournament/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- A clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why you need it.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `common/config.sample.php` to `common/config.php` and update with your database credentials
3. Import `database.sql` into your MySQL/MariaDB database
4. Set up your web server to serve the project directory
5. Navigate to `install.php` to complete the setup

## Coding Style

* Use PHP PSR-12 coding standards
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Comment your code where necessary
* Follow the existing code structure and patterns

## Security
