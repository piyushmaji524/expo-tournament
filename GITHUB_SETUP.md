## Step-by-Step GitHub Upload Process

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

   - **Visibility**: Choose Public (to show your work) or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPOSITORY_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Rename the default branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Complete Command Sequence

```bash
# 1. Add remote origin (REPLACE WITH YOUR GITHUB URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/expo-tournament.git

# 2. Set the main branch
git branch -M main

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify Upload
